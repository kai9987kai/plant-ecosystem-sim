# Vanilla JS Plant Ecosystem Simulation

An interactive plant growth simulation built with vanilla JavaScript. This project simulates a dynamic plant ecosystem, allowing users to grow and harvest plants with unique genetic traits, adapt to changing weather conditions, and control the simulation speed.

## Features

- **Plant Growth Simulation**: Watch plants grow from seeds to mature plants.
- **Genetic Traits**: Each plant has unique genes affecting growth rate, nutrient efficiency, and weather resistance.
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Changing weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy) affect plant growth.
- **Nutrient Management**: Adjust soil nutrient levels to impact plant growth and health.
- **Harvesting System**: Collect seeds from mature plants for replanting.
- **Adjustable Simulation Speed**: Control the pace of the simulation with 1x, 2x, and 10x speed options.
- **Visual Feedback**: Plants change color based on health and sway in windy conditions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vanilla-js-plant-ecosystem-sim.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd vanilla-js-plant-ecosystem-sim
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No additional setup or installation is required as this is a vanilla JavaScript project with no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. **Planting**: Click the "Plant" button to plant a seed in an available soil spot.
2. **Harvesting**: Click the "Harvest" button to collect seeds from mature plants.
3. **Adjusting Nutrients**: Use the nutrient slider to change the soil nutrient level.
4. **Changing Simulation Speed**: Click on the speed buttons (1x, 2x, 10x) to adjust the simulation speed.
5. **Observing**: Watch as plants grow, change color based on health, and react to weather conditions.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the simulation are welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
